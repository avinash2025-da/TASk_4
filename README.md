# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis – E-commerce Project

Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a data analyst internship task focused on using SQL for data analysis. A custom e-commerce dataset was designed and analyzed using MySQL, with all key operations such as data import, table creation, queries, and indexing included.


Dataset Structure
The dataset includes 7 interrelated CSV files with 100+ rows each, structured to support complex SQL queries:

- **Amazon_Sales.csv** – Main transaction data with order info
- **International_Sales.csv** – Global orders with country and shipping data
- **Sale_Report.csv** – Product, brand, pricing, and discounts
- **Profit_Loss_March.csv** – Revenue, cost, and profit per order
- **May_Sales.csv** – Monthly sales for May
- **Expense_IIGF.csv** – Order-related expenses
- **Warehouse_Comparison.csv** – Stock data across warehouses

Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- CSV files
- Custom SQL script

What I Did
- Created a structured SQL database (`EcommerceAnalysis`)
- Defined and created all 7 tables using proper schema
- Imported all data via MySQL's Table Data Import Wizard
- Wrote and executed 15+ analytical queries using:
  - `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`
  - Aggregates (`SUM`, `AVG`)
  - Subqueries
  - Indexing
  - NULL checks
- Captured all key query outputs with screenshots

Sample SQL Queries Included
- Total gross sales by category
- Revenue vs. expense per order
- Profit analysis
- Top 5 high-expense orders
- Average sale by sales channel
- International sales by country
- Monthly revenue summary
- Orders above average revenue
- Inventory alerts for low stock

Output Screenshots
All query results are saved under the `Screenshots/` folder for visual reference.
